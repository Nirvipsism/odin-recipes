    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The croque madame is a French bistro classic, featuring a crispy, golden sandwich filled with ham and cheese, topped with a rich béchamel sauce and a perfectly fried egg. 
        It's a delicious twist on the croque monsieur, adding a touch of elegance with the egg.</p>
    <p>This dish is perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a light lunch, and pairs wonderfully with a crisp green salad and a glass of wine or freshly squeezed juice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of white bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter (softened, plus extra for frying)</li>
        <li>4 slices of ham</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Place 2 slices of bread, buttered side down, in a large skillet over medium heat. Top each slice with 2 slices of ham and a generous sprinkle of Gruyère cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining bread slices on top, buttered side up, to form sandwiches. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and the cheese starts to melt.</li>
        <li>Transfer the sandwiches to a baking sheet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute to create a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Cook until the béchamel sauce thickens, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt, and a dash of pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the tops of the sandwiches and sprinkle with the remaining Gruyère cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>While the sandwiches are baking, fry the eggs in a small skillet with a bit of butter until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny.</li>
        <li>Remove the sandwiches from the oven, place a fried egg on top of each, and serve immediately. Bon appétit!</li>
